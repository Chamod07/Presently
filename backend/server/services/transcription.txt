 I am Rohit, back to Frosty. So, today I will be giving you a small speech on how to give a 2 minute speech for your school or any other place. So, what if you start a speech like this? Good morning all. Cause it will be a boring way guys. So, if you want to start a speech, you could start like everyone, good morning. I don't think it would be good today cause I am going to talk about a serious topic. That's the way you have to start a speech. So, there are few topics which you have to concentrate on. First thing, the first 30 seconds of your speech is going to be the most important part of your speech. I say this because the first 30 seconds people will decide if they have to continue hearing your speech or just they have to leave the place. See, there are 3 things people fear when speaking. One, it would be that if the speakers would like my voice, my punctuation and will my words be clear. Second, will I forget my speech while speaking. Third, will people like my speech? See, the best part here comes is only one thing you people have to remember while making a speech. One, that never make a script to study. Make it into points, like 1 point, 2 point, 3 points, point by point so that you can remember those points while speaking. So, it's only 2 minutes speak. So, I mean 2 minutes speech. So, just prepare 5 to 6 points, think about it. Put on your own language so that you don't forget anything and just make the whole 2 minutes speech very clear and very perfect showing that you have learned it thoroughly. So, thank you guys.
